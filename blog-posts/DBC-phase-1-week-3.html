				New Shores: DBC Phase 1, Week 3
			</h1>
			<p>
				I'm going on to Phase 2, with no assessment necessary. I was surprised that I was told that I was on track and could continue on without my knowledge being tested. I shouldn't have been, considering how well my mock assessment went. I have Object Oriented Design down pretty well (as much as I can be at my skill level), and Ruby has been giving me less guff as I have more experience with it. Now, we move away from Ruby (a comfortable place at this point) and on to Active Record, Sinatra, and a myriad of other frameworks that have their own functions and behaviors. I'm excited to finally build stuff I can show off when Christmas comes round. So far, all we've made is terminal apps (which are awesome), but when showing them to a non-programmmer it isn't very impressive. "It's just a bunch of text." Well yea, but it was really difficult to get the computer to remember stuff and use Active Record and... You get the drill. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				What I'm Proud Of
			</h2>
			<p>
				Team Water's Phase 1 app. We worked really hard for a day and built an amazing terminal app that loads your morning music, the weather (using an API, my first one), and a short to-do list for the morning. I would use it if the thing didn't use an iTunes gem. We worked hard and built all the parts separately, gluing them all together. We stuck to O.O. and single responsibility so it was an easy process. We communicated well, and finished with time to spare.
				<br>
				<br>
				Keeping Pace. I thought I would fall behind, get sick, or just get give up. I have done none of these things. The last one definitely won't happen. I might get sick or fall behind, but I'm not planning on it and will work to prevent it. Sleeping well, eating right, and exercising pays dividends. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Our cohort. Everyone here has been amazing. We stick together, help each other, and pair well. We only have one person repeating, and she took that choice and owned it. It was a choice, and she put her education above all. We also had one person leave the program, but she did it because she wasn't happy. It wasn't her thing, and she knew herself well enough to know she wouldn't be happy. The people in our cohort, repeating or left or going on, we are a strong bunch.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What I'm Scared Of
			</h2>
			<p>
				Not picking up the new material. There's a lot of new stuff, a lot of new syntax. I had a lot of experience with Ruby by the time I reached Phase 1, but now we are moving on to stuff I have never seen before. The fear is made smaller by my cohort's attitude and perserverence. I learn from others better than any other way, so I'm lucky to have such smart people around me.
				<br>
				<br>
				Getting sick or falling behind. Phase 2 is the hardest part, I'm told. I have legitimate projects I have to finish outside of the normal day. I will have to work later than I already was. It's a good thing it's only three weeks.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What I'm Excited For
			</h2>
			<p>
				Everything else. Building more things, things that are actual webpages. Working on more front-end projects. I love design and making stuff that looks good. That's my jam. I love working hard and learning new things. I have to meditate on confusion, relish that moment. That's why I'm here. I'm leaving familiar shores for new ones, and I might get lost at sea a few times. Good thing there are stars to guide me and more experienced crewmen around me.
