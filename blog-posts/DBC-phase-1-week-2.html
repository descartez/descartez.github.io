				On Track: DBC Phase 1, Week 2
			</h1>
			<p>
				Second week down. One more week to go. I had a mock assessment this past week, and my instructors said I am on track. That's a good thing, though there was a part of me that was disappointed I wasn't blowing them away with my wealth of knowledge and know-how. Of course, that little inner critic, my super-ego, is being ridiculous. I'm a perpetual student, a lifelong learner. There is always someone who knows more, and more I need to learn. That being said, I am amazed how much I have learned in just two weeks. I was amazed at the end of Week 1 with what I've learned, and I'm still amazed at the end of Week 2.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've got a rhythm down now. That's important. It keeps me grounded. I'm up by 7:45am every weekday, I get ready and bike to DBC. I work hard with my pair (or solo most Wednesdays), and get as many challenges done as we (or I) can do in the limited time we're given. Lunch is decompress time. I eat food, casually talk through the problems of the day with fellow Boots (some in my cohort, some not). Then it's back to that track, keeping steady pace. Around six it's time for dinner, and then I work a bit and make sure to leave for home by nine.
				<br>
				<br>
				I felt a lot of guilt going home so "early", but I need the time to sleep. I get ready for bed, watch an episode of a show I like (just one, no media binging), and then I'm usually out by 11:30. I make sure to look over the problems of the next day before I conk out. Usually I wake up with some idea of what I want to do, and it keeps me focused on my end goal: to learn as much as possible. Then the cycle starts again.

			<h2>
				The Best School of Failing
			</h2>
			<p>
				Insert Yoda quote about trying here. "Do or do not, there is no try." That's a nice sentiment, but I have to remind myself that "Trying and Failing" is how I learn. It's how everyone learns. And "fail" is a big word to put on amateurish but honest attempts. We talked about the super-ego this past week, that inner critic that tells you "you shouldn't have had that Snickers" or "You shouldn't have watched TV this weekend." It's not evil, it's just unchecked. That voice is there to socialize you, it makes sure you don't curse at your grandma, because <em>you really shouldn't</em>.
				<br>
				<br>
				It just has been given too much license in my life. It gets in the way of actually <em>doing work</em> because it keeps saying, as I walk through my newbie code, that "you should be better than this." I want to do better, it's why I keep studying. It's hard to keep studying when I compare myself to others and wonder why I'm not a pro coder by now. Not exactly a realistic time-scale.
				<br>
			</p>
			<h2>
				Checkin
			</h2>
			<p>
				Checking in with my pairs is another thing that needs practice. I hope my pairs have enjoyed our time together, but regardless I want to work well with them and learn together. When I was stressed at one point, I just told my pair and they said "me too". The stress faded almost instantly. Knowing we both were stressed made the experience less intense. We solved our Sudoku challenge that day, by the way.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm loving the difficulty of the experience of DBC. It forces me to focus and make priorities about where I should be and what I should do. In all honesty, DBC has ruined my idea of free time because all I want to do is code. I want to build things, and I want to build them with great people. DBC is the best place for that. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I always hated the phrase "work hard, play hard" because it is so overused, usually by big burly fathers who tell me that that's the key to success. I have no idea how it is a key though. I understand being more discerning with your free time, and blowing off steam, but not the way others describe it. It always sounds so exhausting. Everyone needs rest. You know what sounds great though? "Do something you're proud of." Far more motivating, knowing that I want to contribute. My little terminal to-do list is not Facebook or Vine, but it is mine. I worked hard and thought long on it, and polished up the rough edges.
				<br>
				<br>
				It's far from perfect by the way, it still has missing functionality but it is a Minimum Viable Product. It finished the challenge and was as polished as I could make it in that time. I like being proud of what I make, and making them with other people makes it something to share. The shared experience is enough to make me proud in what each of my fellow Boots have set out to do. It's insane and wonderful, and I'm proud of them.
