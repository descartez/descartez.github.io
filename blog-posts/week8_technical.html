			Technical Post: Sorting Out Data
		</h1>
		<p>
			When you program, you deal with data. Facebook profiles, email addresses, it's all data. I've talked in the past about <a href="week7_technical.html">databases</a>, but we won't get into that here. What we will get into is something more basic: sorting. There are a multitude of different ways to sort (you can look at how many look and sound <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg">here</a>), but let's just keep it simple. We will stick to comparison sorts (which sort by comparing elements, hence the name) and three of those sorting methods: merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Merge Sort
		</h2>
		<p>
			Merge sort creates a bunch of sublists, and then merges those sublists together into bigger sublists. Soon, all the sublists become the final and only sublist. It looks like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]

#it then splits it into sublists

[4] [5] [3] [1] [2]

#then, combines and merges!

[4, 5] [3] [1, 2]

[4, 5] [1, 2, 3]

#The final list!
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		</pre>
		<h2>
			Quicksort
		</h2>
		<p>
			Quick sort uses a 'pivot'. That's one element in the array that it uses like a dividing line. Then it sorts all elements that are smaller than the pivot before it, and then all elements bigger after that. It looks like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]

#chooses a pivot (shown in "/")

[4, 5, /3/, 1, 2]

[2, 5, /3/, 1, 4]

[2, 1, /3/, 5, 4]

#And done!

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

		</pre>
		<h2>
			Bubble Sort
		</h2>
		<p>
			This has the funniest name out of all of them. Bubble sort compares an element with it's neighbor element then switches those elements to be in the proper order. It looks like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]

#The two elements it's comparing will be in "/", like last time

[/4/, /5/, 3, 1, 2]

#Those are in order, so onto the next!

[4, /5/, /3/, 1, 2]
#Switch!
[4, /3/, /5/, 1, 2]

[4, 3, /5/, /1/, 2]
#Switch!
[4, 3, /1/, /5/, 2]

[4, 3, 1, /5/, /2/]
#Switch!
[4, 3, 1, /2/, /5/]

#And now we start at the beginning again.

[/4/, /3/, 1, 2, 5]
#Switch!
[/3/, /4/, 1, 2, 5]

[3, /4/, /1/, 2, 5]
#Switch!
[3, /1/, /4/, 2, 5]

[3, 1, /4/, /2/, 5]
#Switch!
[3, 1, /2/, /4/, 5]

[3, 1, 2, /4/, /5/]
#Hey, no need to switch! 
#Though... back to the beginning.

[/3/, /1/, 2, 4, 5]
#Switch!
[/1/, /3/, 2, 4, 5]

[1, /3/, /2/, 4, 5]
#Switch! Getting closer...
[1, /2/, /3/, 4, 5]

#And then it goes through the rest and finds it's all in order!
#Final product:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		</pre>'
		<p>
			As you can see, bubble sort makes considerably more steps than the other two. So it's not made for big lists. Even though computers are much faster than they used to be, it's still better to use sorts that are more efficient.
		</p>
		<h2>
			So what to use? 
		</h2>
		<p>
			It depends on the size of your data set. The best thing to look at is their efficiency <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms">here</a>, but I'll break it down for you.
			<br>
			<br>
			Merge sort has an efficiency of <code>n log n</code>, which means for every element <code>n</code>, you multiply it by <code>log n</code>. So if you have 5 elements, <code>5 log(5) = 3.49</code>. Compare that to Quicksort's <code>n log n</code>... huh. About the same. Bubble sort though, that has an efficiency of <code>n**2</code>. So for all elements, it takes the square of that to finish. So with our 5 elements, <code>5**2 = 25</code>. Hence the many, many steps that it took to finish. All of these equations can be put on a big graph to show designers and programmers which might be best. So please, sort responsibly.
