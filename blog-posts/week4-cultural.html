			Cultural Post: Seriously, Where is Everybody? 
		</h1>
		<p>
			This is going to be an odd post for me, because I have never been subject to sexism, racism, or any form of discrimination I can tell of. I'm a white, mid-20s, educated male. I have to say that so no one can assume that I'm talking about this subject from personal experience.
			<br>
			<br>
			Gender and race representation is a big problem for the tech industry. In that there is very little of it. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html">low employment rates and high quite rates</a> among women in STEM careers is troubling. After recent news that <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/05/29/317024113/googles-white-male-heavy-staff-underlines-techs-diversity-problem">Google's workforce is still mostly white and male</a>, a subject that many have known about from personal experience has come to light. It was always there, and it's still a problem. If the tech sector is a supposed meritocracy, you'd think that the demographic of workers would be a bit more diverse. Why isn't this the case?
			<br>
			<br>
			Part of it is education and upbringing. Female students keep up with their male peers in math education until about high school. After that, they are usually discouraged or not expected to perform well, and then that expectation creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. A similar thing happens if you're not white too. That self-fulfilling prophecy is important, because it echoes all the way to adulthood.
			<br>
			<br>
			When people don't hire diversely, they edge out other voices. Since those voices aren't there, it doesn't occur to anyone that there are other voices to hear. That's a lot of potential wasted. Considering that <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/diversity-makes-you-smarter.html">diversity makes us smarter</a>, this should be something to pay attention to. I'm a white guy though, and a main beneficiary of privilege. So clearly there is nothing that I can do. My existence is part of the problem, because I edge out those other voices, right? That's partially true, but that doesn't mean I can't be an ally. That means taking a backseat a lot of the time, being an ally is not the same as being the focus of the story. Diversity is not about my personal feelings. 
		</p>
		<h1>
			So what can I do?
		</h1>
		<p>
			First off, don't do the #notallmen thing. When we talk about privilege, it's very easy to make it about my feelings. I feel hurt when people don't trust me as a male stranger. But that's fine and understandable. There's a saying that: "Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them." That's harsh, but it's true. Males are usually (not always, but mostly) the antagonists and instigators of physical and intimate violence. Other races still have the fresh memory of instituionalized and culturalized racism (that still exist) that favors me over them. Just because I am not personally the instigator does not mean I should ignore that very real fact. It does not mean I do not benefit. Not all men are attackers, but many are, and it seems to be a rampant problem.
			<br>
			<br>
			Secondly, listen and be beholden to others' stories. When you are confronted with or someone tells you about issues of discrimination, don't say "Well I'm sure it wasn't that". You can think the best of people, that's fine. But when someone experiences discrimination, it's too easy for others to play it down. That means that those people will be less likely to bring it up, and silence is not what is needed. If you feel bad or blamed, remember: <strong>this isn't about your feelings.</strong> It's about theirs. And too often their feelings and experiences are silenced.
			<br>
			<br>
			Thirdly, do not interrupt. <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/07/23/study_men_interrupt_women_more_in_tech_workplaces_but_high_ranking_women.html">Men are much more likely to interrupt women</a> than they are of other men. Make space verbally for others. Be very aware of that. Encourage others to speak and give them room to do so. I have a problem with this. The way I learned to talk is to interrrupt and react to others' thoughts and words. That's not always the best situation, since it favors a very certain type of person (someone who is okay with being interrupted and interrupting). But I work at it, and I am not the best at it. It's a process.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, do not encourage or allow racist or sexist comments, jokes, or stories. If someone makes a gay joke, call them out on it. Nothing wrong for being gay. If you can't do that, just don't react to it. Many situations I've been in I can't call people out on (like when a boss of mine made a lewd comment about a female client), for fear of reprisal or conflict. That's understandable. The best I could do was not react. He stopped saying those sorts of things to me because he didn't get the implicit approval that is often looked for with such comments. I also noticed he stopped saying them around me as well, even though there were others around. That's a small improvement, but it is less dumb, sexist stuff floating around in the air.
			<br>
			<br>
			It's a tough road. I've heard people from my high school say they are "tired of everything being made about racism or sexism" (for reference, many of them are white and male). Well, there's a common sentiment going about that. Tired about hearing about it? <em>Try living it.</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			And I know I'm not the best at being an ally. I talk to much, I sometimes forget my privilege and I have to remind myself that the culture-at-large tells me that I am where I am solely because of what I've done. And that's just not true. I was born into a stable family. I was born a particular race in a particular time in a particular tax bracket. I got to go to college because my family could afford it and they had helped me with my homework when I was in high school. But enough about me.
			<br>
			<br>
			Love your neighbor, let them have a voice. Be an ally.
