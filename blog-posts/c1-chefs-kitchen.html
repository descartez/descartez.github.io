		<h3>Culture Blog: Labyrinths and Kitchens vs. Restaurants</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<br>
				As I start this wonderful journey that is Dev Bootcamp, I'm expected to write a blog about my experiences as I go ahead. 
				<br>
				I watched Shareef Bishay's fireside chat, explaining the core principles that drive DBC and how to be successful in it.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm a fan. The way Shereef described this experience as one big experiment appeals to me in  a big way. Life is a process, it's something I've had to learn the hard way and am still learning. A symbol I find spiritually meaningful is the labyrinth. If you've never seen one, tyou can learn more about them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth">here</a>. It's an old symbol, possibly older than writing. The idea is simple. There is only one path to the center, and the path may take you closer or farther from the center, but the center is always your reference point. Once you reach the center, you then have to walk out, meditating on your travels and where you are. It's a process. A meditative one that binds your mind to a place and focuses it. 
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2><em>Kitchen vs. Restaurant:</em></h2>
			</li>
			<li>
				<br>
				There are two attitudes you can take when you enter DBC, one is prescriptive the other is creative/cooperative. The prescriptive attitude is the natural consumerist tendency. It's a restaurant attitude. 
				<br>
				<br>
				"What's on the menu? Oh yes, I'll have the Dev education for this much money. Here's your money, thanks for the skillset. Now to go get a job!"
				<br>
				<br>
				That's not the best attitude. You're not going to learn much because you feel entitled because you paid a certain amount of money. You'll burn out. It doesn't sustain simply because it doesn't deliver immediately. You do the work, you hope you get the skill at the end, and you wait for circumstances to deliver. You'll be waiting for a long time. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The other is creative, creation through cooperation. It's the kitchen attitude. You take ownership of your experience.
				<br>
				<br>
				"We are all in this kitchen together. Some of us may not know how to cut an onion, others of us may know how to make a beef wellington. Our skill levels are different, but we will all make something great."
				<br>
				<br>
				This is more sustainable. It gives you energy because you will take charge of what is happening. You develop your skills so you can keep up, or so you can teach others. When you work in a kitchen together, you want your work to be your best, and you don't let pots boil over. You watch out for each other. You learn from each other. You inspire each other.
				The point is, DBC is not a product or a package, it's a process. It's walking along the labyrinth, getting closer to the center, getting farther, but always moving. Hopefully, you have some people to go along with you. It's all one big experimental journey.

				<h2><em><strong>Where do I land?</strong></em></h2>
			</li>
			<li>
				I want to be in the kitchen, for sure. But I am scared that I'll just do everything by rote, wanting to just get the skills and move on. I'm afraid I'll be one of those cooks who has never chopped an onion properly before. There are two fears that people going into this can have: either that they'll drag people down, or that others will bring them down. My fear is the former rather than latter. I expect to be resolutely in the center. Not too skilled, but not unskilled. Though I don't have a lot of confidence in that.
				<br>
				<br>
				But I get excited thinking of the kitchen. Solving problems. I love cooperation. But talking of the kitchen excites me. I learn from being around people, that's how I reinforce what I've thought of or correct what I've got wrong. Tight feedback loops are important in DBC. Fits me brilliantly. I'm nervous, I'm scared, I'm excited and determined. 
				<br>
				<br>
				All I need to do is keep my eye on the journey, step by step, kitchen by kitchen.
