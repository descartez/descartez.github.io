				Cultural Post: Thinking is all about Style
			</h1>
			<p>
				There are lots of ways to break down how people learn and think. When I was in college, the go-to was the Myers-Briggs Personality Test. It split personality traits into 4 groups of two: Introverted (I) and Extroverted (E), Intuitive (N) and Judging (J), Thinking (T) and Feeling (F), Judging (J) and Percieving (P). There is also an X, which a balance between any of the two qualities. You can read more of it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator#Cognitive_learning_styles">here</a>. We won't be getting into that, since that's not the model we are using in Dev Boot Camp. But for an intro, I am an XNXF. I am equally extroverted and introverted, I'm highly intuitive, I'm equally thinking and feeling, and I'm a perceiver. The perceiver bit is the hardest to get but it just means that I keep information flexibly and thrive on new experiences. That last part will make sense when we talk about the Gregorc Thinking Style.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Gregorc Thinking Styles
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Gregorc Styles are two sets of two. One set being how you perceive the world, Concrete (what you see is what you get) and Abstract (there's more than meets the eye). The other is how you order the world, Sequential (things are connected linearly) and Random (things are connected in chunks). There is no inferior or superior thinking style, it's just different. A hammer isn't better than a saw, unless you're trying to nail something together.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Abstract Random
			</h2>
			<p>
				I am an Abstract Random. That means I'm always looking for underlying causes, not necessarily what I can only see. It's more intuitive, which is consistent with my Myers-Briggs test. I've found I'm better with subtleties and implications than with just the concrete. Unfortunately, that means I can't always explain why I'm thinking or feeling a certain way. I've called that intuition a "vibe" that I get when I'm evaluating a situation. Then comes the Random. I don't take learn in a linear fashion, I take things in chunks. I'm also very kinesthetic and aural; I tie things into place and body sense more along with sound. Kinesthetics are about how they feel in their own bodies. In school, I got into trouble for fidgeting, and later for doodling. The doodling actually helps me concentrate, it centers me and ties me to a place. The aural aspect is helpful when I'm doodling, because I can listen while I look elsewhere.
				<br>
				<br>
				Combined, this Abstract Random guy with kinesthetic and aural aspects has a lot of advantages. I like to listen and work with others, and I learn best with broad guidelines. I like working with people, but I can work on my own as well. The cooperative aspect of my personality has always served me well. Tying to place and people means the Group Pairing Sessions we've been doing is one of the better parts of my week. I'm lucky that I am equally introverted and extroverted, because that means I can switch to solo studying, energized by my pairing sessions.
				<br>
				<br>
				The disadvantage to all of this is that programming is a technical skill. It requires exactness and precision. And since we are doing remote learning there's very little to tie me to a place. It also means I don't thrive well in competition or authoritarian settings. I like to get along and work with people. But that's not too grim of news. I love the problem solving and that overrides everything. I've also found that my kinesthetic attribute ties into the action of typing quite well. I always do my work in a place I've done work before. I've used this strategy when I have had to study intently for school. Sit in a place that's comfortable (but not too comfortable), and work. Then work some more. Whenever you need to work, you go to that place. My mindset is tied into my surroundings, and I've actually got a list of locations around town that I go to when I need to concentrate.
				<br>
				<br>
				Great news, though! No one is purely one thinking style. We have a bit of everything, with strong tendency to one side or another. I've noticed my precision has improved, as has my ability to explain my thought process and angle of approach to problems. When I started, I used a lot of terms interchangeably, which was not ideal. I have been getting better though, my need to communicate trumps my normal reaction to ignore tenchnicalities and specificity. It's probably a good thing the human mind is not a static thing.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Growth vs. Fixed Thinking
			</h2>
			<p>
				Even greater news! The human mind is not a static thing! Intelligence is pretty mutable, and even knowing that makes you smarter! Learning a skill is hard, and how you view intelligence plays a huge part into your success. If you think intelligence is something you're born with, something that is unchangeable, you're not going to learn much. When you run into difficulties (and you will), you'll just chalk it up to you not being "really" smart. But that's not how it works! Having a growth-focused thinking is better. Intelligence isn't fixed, so it can be grown and difficulties just mean you're working hard! I didn't want to believe that intelligence wasn't fixed. It was more convenient to believe that learning was hard because I didn't have "the right stuff". But as I've been learning, and evidenced by the above, I'm increasing my intelligence and learning despite difficulty. So do not give up hope! Difficulty is normal, expected, and not the end.
