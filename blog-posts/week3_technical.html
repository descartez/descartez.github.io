				Technical Post: Javascript, like reading an Oracle
			</h1>
			<p>
				<em>I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.</em>
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>-Plato</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				Well, at the beginning of this week, looking at Javascript, I felt like the wisest man alive, like our friend Plato here. And by wisest man, I mean I knew absolutely nothing. Javascript looked entirely different from Ruby. Ruby looks like this:
				<br>
				<br>
				<code>
					print "Hello, World!\n"
				</code>
				<br>
				<br>
				And JavaScript looks like this:
				<br>
				<br>
				<code>
					console.log("Hello")
				</code>
				<br>
				<br>
				or
				<br>
				<br>
				<code>
					console.log(functionMethod)
				</code>
				<br>
				<br>
				They look similar really, except <code>console.log</code> can be used for anything. It's just a way of running the function you put together. Or displaying a string. If you want to do that in Ruby, you just put down the name of the function. In reality, they actually aren't that different. But to my untrained eye, it was like reading technically written english and some form of Olde English. It resembled something I knew, but not close enough to actually mean anything. Maybe I was having a bad day. JavaScript is a second language to me,it <em>is</em> the second programming language I've actually known. Ruby being my first.
				<br>
				<br>
				For good or ill, JavaScript is a popular language for the web, and therefore required learning for an aspiring web developer such as I. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Why so popular?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Among the many reasons for using JavaScript, two stand out to me the most. The first is that JavaScript can use constructors to build various functions and objects. This mean that you can create a variety of similar objects all in one go. Secondly, everything is constructed in an environment like a browser. That means that things can be modified and displayed on the page without needing to leave the page. You can post your Facebook status without having to go to a "post status" page and view others' statuses without going to a "view status" page. It also can operate without needing to call to a server. It's all done in the user's client. That's all pretty dang handy. 

			</p>
			<h2>
			Sounds great! What's the catch?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Javascript has it's place, but it does have it's weaknesses. One of them is security. A knowledgable malefactor can insert their own code into the JavaScript as it loads. The offending party can then execute what they have insterted without the knowledge of the user. Nowadays, browsers have standards in place that make it much harder to do mischief with, but that still doesn't eliminate the weakness of the language.
				Another weakness is that there is no way to hide the code that is being used. This may not be a weakness to those of us who use open-source software, but to those concerned with intellectual property rights, this is a major weakness.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Gonna keep on keepin' on
			</h2>
			<p>
				We've covered some of JavaScript's strengths and weaknesses, but I haven't really touched on something I didn't realize. In my research, JavaScript is like Ruby in that they have a low barrier of entry. This was shocking, considering how much trouble I had entering in. But then I thought back. I had the same frustration for Ruby when I started. The fault lay with me. But! That's the wonderful thing about persistence and practice. You get somewhere, if you are deliberate enough. I've got the persistence, now all that's left is the practice!
