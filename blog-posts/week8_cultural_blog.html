			Cultural Post: Sorting Out Conflict
		</h1>
		<p>
			Someone hurts your feelings. Maybe they dump you, or say something insensitive. You start feeling something. If you pay attention, you notice your pulse flutters a bit. You're cheeks flush. It really hurts. That's your body, we all have one, and it has a mind of it's own. Your brain doesn't <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/04/rejection.aspx">differentiate physical pain and social rejection</a> either, so when you feel that moment of discomfort, it's the same as breaking an arm or getting burned.
			<br>
			<br>
			That's all very interesting, but it doesn't really address conflict. In that moment of pain, you have a lot of choices. Sometimes you make the wrong ones. I know I have.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Conflict is a Reaction
		</h2>
		<p>
			While I was traveling in Ireland (I wrote about those trips <a href="week7_cultural.html">earlier this week</a>), my group and I ate dinner a lot. We got to know each other pretty well, and in one of our dinner conversations one of our number said something that angered me. This isn't verbatim, but it's the gist of it.
			<br>
			<br>
			<em>"Ya we would throw this guy in the shower and laugh, it was all in good fun."</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			My groupmate had been talking about his time doing sports, and how his team would always rag on a guy, just joking around. I told him that that wasn't right. He said it was all in good fun. My heart raced a bit, I was upset. I've been bullied before, and I've seen it done to others, all in the name of "boys being boys" or "good fun". That was unacceptable.
			<br>
			<br>
			I didn't explode as far as I could tell, but it got very tense very quick. I have strong feelings about people who do that sort of thing and say it's "good fun". It's not. That's an insensitive excuse to cover up real emotional pain. It didn't help that my groupmate was about 6'+ and clearly played a bunch of sports. For those who don't know me, I'm about 5'10" and haven't been that athletic until recently. So I felt physically threatened even though my friend (and we were friends) wasn't angry or threatening violence. That fear after speaking out lead to intensity (and anger).
			<br>
			<br>
			That anger was tied to something deep in me, and it was purely reactionary. I felt threatened, so my anger probably was apparent. We debated a bit. <em>Hazing is a horrible thing, you can't say that I was hazed and it was fine, I doubt that, etc.</em> I forget how it was resolved, but we still see each other and we are more than happy to talk. No lasting bad came out of that discussion, I got to see a bit in his head, but by the end everything was fine. (Though I did spend some time alone that night, trying to calm myself down when fresh memories surfaced.)
		</p>
		<h2>
			Later...
		</h2>
		<p>
			I was talking to my professor later that week, and they brought up our dinner 'discussion'. She asked if I was angry at my groupmate. I said no. That was true. I knew he wasn't a bad person, I'd seen him react to the same things I was seeing (I won't get into the gritty details, but Northern Ireland can be messed up), and he clearly cared for those in our group. She continued, saying that some people brought it up as a scary moment. Some students were uncomfortable about that discussion we had.
			<br>
			<br>
			Honestly? I was surprised. I thought that once the discussion was over, so were the problematic emotions and that everyone had forgotten about it. Clearly not. It was a good teaching moment. People see you, and they don't see the same things you do.
		</p>
		<h2>
			You're eyes decieve you
		</h2>
		<p>
			When we look in the mirror, we usually have a good opinion of ourselves. Hopefully that's true. But people see different things. That moment at the dinner table was a tense moment, but it had passed. Others remembered it. Memory is important, but it causes problems too. When I heard that phrase "it's all in good fun", I immediately flashed back to when I was younger, sad and angry and scared. I flashed back to all the times my sister told me girls had said truly horrible things about her at school. All the times I was made to feel bad for who I was or who my sister was just flooded in, uninvited.
			<br>
			<br>
			I wasn't just reacting to the statement, but to all the memories that it represented. That makes conversation difficult. We always flash back or have our own reactions to words and actions that others don't give a passing thought to.
			<br>
			<br>
			Take a look at the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">Compass of Shame</a>. Where do you think I ran to? Fear leads to anger, as Yoda has said. I ran right for the Northwest. I attacked, even though we were in a safe space, having a good time up until my friend's one sentence. I felt afraid, then once I had said something about it, ashamed that I was now the center of attention. My friend also responded in kind. That's how it got heated. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			What would I have changed?
		</h2>
		<p>
			I wish I had taken a breath. No feeling is truly permanent, especially sudden anger and fear. I wish I could have said, "That's not cool. That's not a good thing." Instead I said "That's horrible. That's not right." It's true, but I said it in a way that made my friend feel threatened. So it raised the stakes. My personal experiences got in the way of me sharing those experiences. Rather than talk about how bullies had used the phrase to excuse themselves or why I felt so strongly about it, I just got scared and angry instead. It was still constructive by the end, because we were deliberate about how we ended it. We made sure the other felt heard. But if we hadn't? It probably would've resurfaced again and caused problems.
			<br>
			<br>
			I want to end on that note: that we were deliberate about resolution. Being deliberate is hard. It takes effort, and when you're emotional, effort is not something that comes naturally. I just went straight to my honed reflexes that told me I was in trouble. I wasn't.
			<br>
			<br>
			There was a phrase we used a lot while we studied the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It was "Make sure you go to the balcony". It means you take a breath, and remove yourself from the situation for a moment. Sometimes that means physically leaving, other times it just means waiting a beat. It's okay for there to be silence. Americans and the Irish don't like silence, but let it happen. Once you've gone to the balcony, you can see above the problems. You're looking down on it, and you may not be objective, but you're less attached to the situation. Just enough so you can return with a clear head.
			<br>
			<br>
			At the end, my friend made sure I was okay. I said yes, and made sure he was okay too. He said yes. Until my professor brought it up later, I hadn't really thought about it. But we were fine. He's a good man, and he learned that not everyone is okay with "jokes" like that. I learned that even people I saw as a threat are still people, they have feelings and provided you both care about the other in good faith, it all works out.
