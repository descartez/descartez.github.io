			Cultural Post: Wanting's Got Nothing To Do With It
		</h1>
		<p>
			I mentioned in one of my last posts about how <a href="week4-cultural.html">representation matters</a>. Diversity is important, it makes us smarter, and it offers opportunity to others who have historically been given the short end of the stick. But don't we live in a post-racial society? Racism is gone! Jim Crow certainly is. Everybody has an equal chance to get where they want to be! That's crazy honestly. If it really came down to "wanting something bad enough", everyone would have exactly what they wanted. We know this isn't true. If it came down to hard work, I would've had more high paying jobs after I graduated from college, despite the poor economic climate. Truthfully, our situations dictate how we act, no one is born in a vacuum. Because of this, that means that there are societal forces which uplift some and hurt others. Oftentimes without our own knowledge. The mistake is assuming because you don't see the Klan hanging around in the open that means that racism is over. Racism and societal biases are often equated to Jim Crow laws and lynchings, and that's not accurate. Racial and representational bias is subtle, and not always overtly hateful.
			<br>
			<br>
			As per my last post about diversity, the same disclaimer applies: I am a white, straight, young male. I have not experienced the brunt of racism, sexism, or bias and most likely have benefitted from such things because of my racial and economic background.

		<h1>
			Stereotype Threat and Identity
		</h1>
		<p>
			Stereotype threat is one of the subtle symptoms of bias. The concept is pretty simple: When you identify with a group, and that identity is brought forward, it affects your performance. It can affect your performance positively or negatively. Sometimes it works in your favor. That is if your white and male. When women are told to solve a math problem, and that it is going to judge gender differences in regards to math performance, women do poorer than men. Sadly, to many, that's where their thought process ends. Women just can't handle numbers as well as men! False. Because if the same challenge is presented as a puzzle, with no emphasis on gender, both groups perform about the same. So it's not a matter of whether women handle numbers "worse" than men. It's a matter of that assumption (which I've heard my high school math teacher spout to his mixed-gender class) being brought forward. You worry about your performance because you're <a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-events/the-stereotype-threat-dr-claude-steele-mesmerizes-audience-video/">identity is being focused on</a>, and you do poorer. This leads to self-fulfilling prophecies, and really helps no one. A similar effect occurs with the SATs. Originally, when the demographic questions were put at the start of the test (name, age, race, etc.), blacks and latinos did poorer than whites. But when the questions are put at the end, everybody does about the same. But no one would say that they did poorer because their race or gender got brought up. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This all means that our expectations about our identity affect our performance, even when we aren't aware of it. 
		</p>
		<h1>
			Why it matters, what to do
		</h1>
		<p>
			It's a question for the ages honestly. I don't really have an answer. Part of a solution has something to do with awareness. If a teacher is aware of the biases that undermine performance how can he/she address them? It can't be all on them, there's a whole society that views and represents people groups in certain ways. When a white dude shoots up a school headlines read: "10 Dead in School Shooting". When a woman is violent headlines read: "Woman shoots 10 People". The white guy is erased from the headline, but the woman is highlighted. Same goes for race when a black guy shoots someone. Race and gender are highlighted when they are not said attributes are white and male. 
			<br>
			<br>
			When media portrays women as dumb, or always deffering to men, how do you think that teaches them to behave? How do you think it affects math scores? When black people are said to be looters, but white people are said to be survivors (in the case of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina), how do you think that makes people act? And how does that make us treat each other?
			<br>
			<br>
			The answer is poorly. We short-change people and they in turn short change themselves, even if they don't realize it. That's why we need more voices championed in media and in the workplace. That means people who are part of the priviliged group (white, straight, male) need to be allies. That means stepping aside and letting others thrive. Support more diverse media, because representation matters. It's how you subvert unseen biases like these, giving more examples of all types of people in all types of situations, so that the "women aren't good at science/math" is subverted by the image of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Madam Curie</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin">Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin</a>. (Read about Dr. Payne-Gaposchkin there. She figured out what the stars are made of.) The same goes for any other disenfranchised group. Just google the history of black people in Medieval Europe, or read about how many women contributed to science and had their work stolen or ignored. The history and world we have been shown isn't all there is.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've seen representation matter when I read comics. There aren't a lot of black or latino characters. Often the heroes are white and male. Just look at the cast of the Avengers. Only one women on the team roster. (And she is awesome. Where the hell is the Black Widow movie?) But in printed comics, there's been a shift. Something that is very important. The young lady who took the Ms. Marvel mantle is a Muslim woman. The Spiderman webshooters have been passed on to Miles Morales, an african-latino kid. Kids are so happy to see someone who looks like them, who has the same identity they have fighting evil and doing good. And that matters. Because when that math test comes around, that kid might be thinking "Hey, Miles Morales is pretty good at math. Maybe I can be too." That little bit of "maybe I can too" makes you smarter. Just thinking you are smarter makes you smarter (in one of the weirdest neurological twists).
			<br>
			<br>
			So support more diverse media. Go watch "How to Get Away with Murder" (of the main cast, only one is white, male, and straight) or "Sleepy Hollow" (two out of three main characters are black women). They're amazing shows. Truly. Buy Ms. Marvel comics (Malala, the title's namesake is amazing), or Ultimate Spiderman (Miles Morales' title), or The Young Avengers comics (young adults, with a gay couple, several characters of color, and kickass stories). It makes you more empathetic, and it helps support voices that haven't always been heard.
