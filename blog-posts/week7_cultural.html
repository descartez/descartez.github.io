			Cultural Post: def values
		</h1>
		<p>
			Values in computing are just numbers or strings assigned to variables. Values for people are ideals and qualities they admire or aspire to (as a person, you know the latter; if you are a computer, I'm sorry you cannot feel love). So I'm supposed to talk about my own values. But first, let me tell you about when I feel the most accomplished and alive. It's when I'm traveling. I've traveled to every continent except for Australia and Antarctica. I love moving, figuring out where to go, seeing history and different people in their natural environments. I've been pretty lucky that way. When I traveled to Ireland a few years ago, it was to study <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles">the Troubles</a>. It was an intense experience. I learned about how violence can continue through generations, and what it takes to face that pain. I heard a lot of stories from people who were brutalized and beaten and chose to not continue the cycle. I also heard from others who were not ready to forgive. 
			<br>
			<br>
			It seems like a downer, and it wasn't always happy, but I learned a lot about others and myself. I learned intellectually, but also emotionally from others. I returned to Ireland two years later (via Jerusalem) to study religious pilgrimage, and saw the green isle with more hope than last time. I've felt most accomplished when I'm learning, with others, and contributing to something.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Value 1: Cooperation
		</h1>
		<p>
			When you travel in a group, you have to work together. It takes coordination to get to a different place with all your fingers and toes. More importantly than just moving from place to place, you have to keep in good spirits with each other. Travel is tiring, and being far from the familiar is an emotional roller coaster at times. Everything is new and fascinating, but not always comfortable.
			<br>
			<br>
			Most travel I've done has been with a purpose: medical missions to South America, Mexico, and Africa; studying in Jerusalem, Ireland, Italy. Travel on its own is great, but it's good to have a goal. When I was in Ireland it was to learn from those there, on top of rigorous academics with other students. We had to show we had learned in interesting ways, often together. Volunteering featured heavily as well.
			<br>
			<br>
			I learned I love to work in teams, everyone has something to teach me, even if it's not technical or academic knowledge. I don't know how others might see me, but I work hard to work with others. I may fail sometimes, but I think I do a good job.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Value 2: Growth
		</h1>
		<p>
			While cooperation is more to do with others, growth is more introspective. I love to grow in as many ways that I can. If you come to know me, you'll find I've picked up bits of knowledge from all over (for some reason, I know way more than I should about con men, international crime, and animal biology). In the same way I pick up knowledge, I pick up on experiences. Anything that increases my skills and understanding, anything others can teach me that can make me a more proficient human is always welcome.
			<br>
			<br>
			The best way I can put it is with this random fact: plants grow better when surrounded by other plants. They compete for the same sunlight, they create ideal conditions for themselves (and then by extension, other plants). They grow because they are around growing things. While this may sound like hippy talk, it really comes down to this: I do best when I'm surrounded by people who are just as interested in growing and telling stories and working together. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I value all types of growth, not just the technical or intellectual. I like seeing it in others because it inspires me to reach for a bit more sunlight, to put my roots a little deeper into the soil.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Do I hold up?
		</h1>
		<p>
			It's hard to know how well you hold to your values. I will never experience anything other than myself. I feel my own skin, breathe my own air, see with my own eyes. I never see through others' eyes, not really. Empathy is a wonderful thing, since it gives us a little glimpse into others, but I'm always afraid I'll be just egotistical enough to think I am perfect right where I am. It keeps me going. I think I value cooperation and growth enough to say I match up well with them. But when I don't there's always <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_of_Saint_Francis">this</a> to remind me.

			"Grant that I may not so much seek
			<br>
			To be consoled as to console;
			<br>
			To be understood as to understand;
			<br>
			To be loved as to love.
			<br>
			For it is in giving that we receive;
			<br>
			It is in pardoning that we are pardoned;"
