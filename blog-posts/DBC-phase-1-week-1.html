				Hands at Work: DBC Phase 1, Week 1
			</h1>
			<p>
				Last week was the first week of Dev Boot Camp. First day was great, the intros, the enthusiasm, I knew I was going to like it here. But as the week went on, I knew I would still like it here but it was going to be hard.
				<br>
				Difficulty is not something you can really explain to someone else. It's something you experience. You can know intellectually that something will be hard, but the emotion is removed from the act. So I started. Challenges are challenging. Tautology is tautology. Work is work. Weaknesses in my practices were revealed. Things I need to work on, things I learned on the fly.
				<br>
				Sublime shortcuts! So many! I never spent much time in Phase 0 working on them, but I knew that I would learn them better by using them in the fray. Every day there's a new shortcut, a new technique that's ancillary to the actual code but still on the edges of the actual coding.
				<br>
				Math! Not the word problem, finish-your-homework-by-Monday sort of math. The kind in between every day use and the things that make the world run. Using division without the remainder (or a float) in order to find the nature of data. Taking abstract structures and making them into solid logic uses mathematical principles that wouldn't have come to me if I had taken a brute-force approach to the challenge.

				Drinking From the Fire Hose
			</h2>
			<p>
				I keep geting told "You don't have to finish everything", "breadth not depth", and "trust yourself". I was not taught to take any of these words to heart. I've taken my education into my own hands for the first time, and I am responsible. I am drinking from a firehose. Learning programming in just nine weeks? All of it? Impossible. So why feel guilty that some water spills on the ground?
				<br>
				I have to keep telling myself that I should try my hardest but not burn out. College trained me to deprive myself of food, sleep, and basic sanity to get things done. That won't work here. I have to bike to keep myself fit. I have to eat right to keep myself healthy. I have to stop when I've jumped into a rabbit hole that is keeping me from learning more. It takes hard work. 
				<br>
				There's something uplifting about being responsible for your own learning. As I apply what I know, when I can solve problems, I realize that I know that because I paid attention and was deliberate. It's amazing! But it's also scary. I'm lifted up, but it can be a long way down. The challenges are there to push me in ways I wouldn't have thought possible. It's great! I don't know something, so now I can learn it! There's something great about being the dumbest person in the room. It means you can grow and learn. (To be honest, I'm not the dumbest one in the room, I don't think. I don't think any of us are, we just think we are.) That growth, that empathy that can arise from adversity is a literal high. It's a rush. I love it.
				<br>
				Dev Boot Camp has done good for me. I can talk with my cohort about technical challenges, every word being a technical term for some process or method I wouldn't have understood six months ago. The other thing it's done is ruined free time for me. It's a good thing, because I don't veg out and just watch TV. I can't. My mind is active and wants to try different approaches to problems or just learn more. There's so much to learn, and I love it.
				<br>
				<br>
				These are a hands of a programmer. They are new, and do not have the calluses of typing into the wee hours. Doesn't matter. They will get rough, I will get more experience. That's what I'm here for. It's what I've set out to do.
