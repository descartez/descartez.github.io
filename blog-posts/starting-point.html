  <div class="reflection">
      Using percentages rather than pixels makes changing values in the format easier for me. I understand percentages better than I do pixel values. I think it's because I am more intuitive than anything, I understand general principles and the "feel" of something instead of absolute values. I can work with absolute values of course; but messing with a percentage is flexible, while pixel values are not. 

      <ul>

          <em><strong>What parts of your strategy worked?</strong></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Messing with percentages within the element I was working on, and setting the overall percentage (like the percentage of the body or content divs) to a simple 95% made adjusting easier. Also using percentages as margins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>What problems did you face?</strong></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Making the navbar display horizontally rather than vertically. It took us a while to understand what we were doing wrong.

          <em><strong>What questions did you have while coding? 
          </strong></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          While I haven't had issues with clashing percentages before, what happens if two percentages clash? (For example, ul is 100%, but li is 300%)
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><strong>What resources did you find to help you answer them?</strong></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          I just messed with the values and found that the items would reach past the boundary of ul.
        </li>
        <li>
        <em>
          <strong>
          What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
          </strong>
        </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          If you make an li have it's own boundaries, floats, or other modifiers, it will still be bound by the css that governs the ul element. That way, you can block out the space you want while still manipulating how the li looks. It's not perfect, but it makes making navbars easier.

        <li>
          As said above, how to use percentages within boundaries of less specific elements (like ul and li).

        <li>
          I think I've got it! This took less time and was much easier to modify than code I've used previous. Anything that makes formatting easier is a win in my book!

        <li>
          Messing with the margins, padding, and borders. It's so much easier when you use percentages, and you can see results quicker and modify them to suit your needs more easily. If you want a simple bit of margin on any specific side, just make the value 1% or 5% and that seems to work just fine. I'm glad I enjoyed it though! I don't think I've enjoyed formatting too much until this point.

        </li>
        <li>
          The only tedious part was messing with the navbar. But even that wasn't too bad, we just had to mess with it a bit.
