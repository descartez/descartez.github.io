				Technical Post: Cycle, Cycle, Ad Infinitum
			</h1>
			<p>
				Alright, let's talk about Enumarable#cycle. It's written like this
			</p>
			<pre>
array = [1, 2, 3]
array.cycle {|x| puts x}
			</pre>
			<p>
				Which would then yeild this:
			</p>
			<pre>
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 #And it will go on forever
			</pre>
			<p>
				If it will go on forever, what's the point? It'll just run until it runs out of memory and crashes the whole system. Doesn't seem too useful. But what if we did this?
			</p>
			<pre>
array.cycle(3) {|x| puts x}
			</pre>
			<p>
				That would yeild this:
			</p>
			<pre>
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3
			</pre>
			<p>
				It repeats the array three times, and now has a limit. So now it won't crash the system. That's a relief. So what do we do now?
			</p>
			<h2>
				A More Practical Example
			</h2>
			<p>
				Here's the code:
			</p>
				<pre>
some_months = ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "April"]
some_counter = some_months.cycle do |month|
puts month
break if month == "April"
end
				</pre>
				<p>
				Which will yeild:
				</p>
				<pre>
"Jan"
"Feb"
"March"
"April"
				</pre>
				<p>
				So we can run it until it ends. What if we want to run it one at a time?
				</p>
				<pre>
some_counter = some_months.cycle
some_counter.next
				</pre>
				<p>
				Which will yeild:
				</pre>
				<pre>
"Jan"
				</pre>
				<p>
				And if we do it again?
				</p>
				<pre>
"Feb"
				</pre>
				<p>
				Hmmm. That's pretty useful! So we can use it to create loops of code. If you want to go backwards a bit, just do:
				</p>
				<pre>
some_counter.rewind
				</pre>
				<p>
				Which will yeild:
				</p>
				<pre>
"Jan"
				</pre>
				<p>
				So we can go backwards and forwards. If we reach the end, it will actually wrap around and start over. But remember! If you don't put a limiter on the thing, it will run forever. Luckily, .next yeilds an element one at a time. Same with .rewind.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Other Things to Consider
				</h2>
				<p>
					Cycle will also work with two dimensional arrays, and if you use the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-zip">.zip method</a> to combine two single dimensional arrays, then use cycle to show each element (which is another array), and the grouped info. It also works with hashes, another way to show grouped data. 
					<br>
					Cycle can work as a counter for info, or just a straight up counter.
					<br> 
					Fool around with it! Experiment! Just remember, if you get stuck in a loop, use ctrl+c to break the run.
