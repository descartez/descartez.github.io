			<h1>
				Technical Post: It's all absolutely relatively fixed.
			</h1>
			<p>
				When you're writing up your website, formatting is a big deal. It's what makes a site look readable, rather than a long laundry list with no rhyme or reason to it. There is some reason to it, we should hope. You did write it after all. 

				There is reason to it. If the browser is displaying your content and it's relatively readable, then that means you wrote things in the HTML that separate the content. All of these things are static, which means they won't be influenced by things like browser size, position and other circumstances. Then how do we better organize it though? Well, you can make the content have backgrounds and borders and the like, but what if they aren't exactly where we want them? There are a lot of ways to do it, but we'll just focus on three types of positioning: <strong>Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.</strong>
			</p>
			<h2>
				<em>Relative:</em>
			</h2>
			<p>
				When you are considering how to move something one way or the other, relative positioning is one of the more confusing ones. Why? Because it's relative. It's not relative to other elements per se, but it's relative to <em>itself</em>. When I see that, I think about some zen master, telling me that I should be relative to my self, from my worries. Whatever that means. What it really means, zen aside, is that the element (the thing called content that's been defined) will be relative to where it should be. If you just write it in the css as "display: relative", nothing is going to happen. But if you say "display: relative; right: 15px" or "display: relative; left: 15px" it will display it right or left, 15 pixels from <em>where it would be</em> if we didn't say anything. It's like moving a chess piece 3 spaces to your left. It's not where it is usually, but you moved it, so that doesn't matter. Careful though! If you move too many things relatively without keeping track of it all, it can get messy. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Absolute:
			</h2>
			<p>
				It sounds so ominous doesn't it? Like a thundering voice: "This element's position is <strong>absolute</strong>." Fear not! It's not that ominous, but it is powerful. This makes an element stick where you put it. It will stay there, but it will also not be affected by other bits on the page. If you put a picture in a paragraph as absolute, the text will go over the picture. Anything you set as absolute, and all elements that are grouped with it will be unaffected by the things around it.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Fixed:
			</h2>
			<p>
				Let's say you want to make your banner stay at the top of the page, or a sidebar to stay on the side, and you wanted either to follow the user no matter how much they scrolled down. This is it! This is the thing that let's you do that. Well, one of the ways to do it. When you look through a camera, the reticle will always stay with you no matter what you're aiming it at. You won't point it at a dog and then at a bird and find that the reticle is still focused on the dog. Fixed works on a similar principle, no matter where you are looking on the page, this will follow you, framing what you are looking at or providing links to more content. 
			</p>
			<h2>
				Conclusion:
			</h2>
			<p>
				All of these things can make a website more dynamic, look better, and easier to navigate. Provided they are used properly. I'm still learning it myself. Each option has it's advantages: Relative let's you move things from where they are to where they should be, based on where they are. Absolute makes an element stick where you put it, no matter what's happening around it. Fixed lets you make content follow the user.
				<br>
				<br>
				They do have their difficulties though. Relative can get confusing, especially if you overuse it and nothing is where it should be based on good design. Like a chessboard with it's pieces in arbitrary places, it makes it pretty hard to play. 
				<br>
				Absolute is great for when you don't want anything to move, but it can become overlapped by other content.
				<br>
				Fixed is great for menus, but if the user has a tiny screen, the content can get in the way.
				<br>
				<br>
				All of these things, when used wisely, work pretty darn good. All it takes is  practice to know when to use one over the other, or to use any of them at all. So get at it!
