			Technical Post: All Bout Dat Base, DataBase
		</h1>
		<p>
			Sometimes you have a bunch of data you have to keep track of. Sometimes you have a lot of it. Sometimes, writing it down on a napkin isn't enough. So you decide to build a little computer file with the info you need. Then you organize it nicely, all columns and rows. Soon, the file gets huge, and you've also made other files to correspond to different things. So... turns out you accidently built a database. 
			<br>
			<br>
			You didn't mean anything by it, and I'm sure you tried your hardest to keep it simple and to not wade too deep into the data pool. But life is not easy, and there is a lot of data that needs to be based. Databases are a necessary thing in computing, they make Facebook and Twitter and Email and a whole lot of other things work. So how are they made?
		</p>
		<h1>How It's Made</h1>
		<p>
			Columns and rows. That's how they are made. A bunch of columns and rows, like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
			phone
			+----+---------+-------------+
			| id |  name   |  number     |
			+----+---------+-------------+
			  1    Bob		(714)344-5000
			  2	   Alan     (805)554-2240
			  #and so on and so forth
		</pre>
		<h1>That's it</h1>
		<p>
			No it's not! There's a lot more to it. These collections of columns and rows are called tables. These tables can be joined with others using SQL statements (SQL stands for Structured Query Language) to combine and call info. At a certain point, that phone list I showed you is going to get pretty huge. I have a lot of contacts (I may want to add a last name column in there at some point). On top of that, each name might have another table attached to it, separate from the phone table, telling me what Bob's home address, email, and greatest fears are. Even with our small list here, "Bob" contains 3 extra bits of data in another table somewhere. We can get to them easy. That's not the problem, the problem is Alan has a similar "address/email/greatest fears" (we'll call it the fears) table. As the list gets bigger and bigger, our database will grow exponentially. 
		</p>
		<h1>
			Searching...
		</h1>
		<p>
			SQL databases use queries (those SQL statements I mentioned earlier) to call, combine, and display data. If I wanted to find "Zahid" and his number in my phone list table, I'd type:
		</p>
		<pre><code>
			SELECT name, number FROM phone list
			WHERE name = 'Zahid'
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			That would give me his name and number, displayed in one row with two columns. Pretty straightforward. But if I wanted to find if certain users had a fear of spiders? I'd put this:
		</p>
		<pre><code>
			SELECT name, number FROM phone JOIN fears
			WHERE fears = 'spiders'
		</code></pre>
		<p>
			I just want to make sure I bring some spider repellent next time I visit anyone on my growing list of people. Everytime you do this (and there are lots of ways to search, by numbers, by certain characters being in certain sections, by keywords, by id) it takes time. So there are ways to make requests more effecient. It can get pretty technical, playing with how searches are made (a good article listing more than a few ways <a href="http://hungred.com/useful-information/ways-optimize-sql-queries/">here</a>) but here's some general rules.
			<br>
			<br>
			First, limit the amount of columns you return. If my phone table had 18 columns (such as race, salary, etc.), I would only call the things I wanted, like names and ages, rather than every little thing on the table and find the info I wanted myself. Why bog your mind down with trying to search on a screen when you can make the computer do the lifting and still somehow go faster because you asked it to do less work?
			<br>
			<br>
			Second, be more specific (and by extension, more readible) in your requests. If you are looking for something greater than or equal to 5 (in any part of your table), don't use <code>>4</code> to look for it. That means your poor query has to process the number 4 before it even gets to 5 and the things greater than it. Just use <code>>=5</code>, it doesn't have to count something it won't use. You can apply this principle to any value you might use. Be lazy. Don't do more work than you have to.
		</p>
		<h1>
			Not Only SQL
		</h1>
		<p>
			There is another way of building a database, as there is always more than one way to build a house. That way is called NoSQL or Not Only SQL. This is a way of building a database using less centralized methods and more dynamic naming and categorization. Unlike SQL, you don't need to order all the info you're gathering ahead of time and rather than contain things in columns and rows, it puts things into graphs and key-value pairs. You can take in more data and process it much faster this way. Data is not centrally stored either, and this more distributed approach means all you have to do is add more hardware to keep up with more data. That means it's cheaper and faster to maintain and use. So why don't we use this all the time?
			<br>
			<br>
			Well... because it's new. And less structured. There's less support for NoSQL databases out there at the moment, and since using NoSQL queries requires a little more expertise to use than SQL queries, it's not used as often. With the internet getting faster and users gaining more expertise (many call us young'uns "digital natives"), it's going to catch on. It is cheaper after all.
