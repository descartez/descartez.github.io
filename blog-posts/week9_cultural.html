				Cultural Post: Questions Get Answers
			</h1>
<pre>
“Albert grunted. "Do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions?"
Mort thought for a moment.
"No," he said eventually, "what?"
There was silence.
Then Albert straightened up and said, "Damned if I know. 
Probably they get answers, and serve 'em right.” 
― Terry Pratchett, Mort

			<p>
				If you haven't read any Terry Pratchett, I'm sorry you're missing out. His voice and humor are unmatched. His work also makes you ask questions. Usually, it's 'Why do I think that about things?' or 'Wait. The vampire is a teetotaler?' Okay, the last one is just me. But I highly recommend his work.
				<br>
				<br>
				Questions are how we first start on the road to knowledge. Not knowing something is exciting. You don't know something! Now you can find out (hopefully)! But phrasing the question is just as important as the answer. And if you can't answer the question yourself, you'll have to consult someone else. But how, asks some imaginary construct I created for rhetorical purposes, do we ask a good question?
			</p>
			<h2>
				The Anatomy of a Good Question
			</h2>
			<p>
				Start with specifics. What are you trying to figure out? What specific terms can you use? Make sure that the response won't just be a <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-amazingly-good-asking-questions.html">yes or no question</a>. Unless it's a marriage proposal. Then do whatever you want.
				<br>
				<br>
				So the question should be specific. It shouldn't be "why isn't this thing working?" It should be "Why isn't this particular thing not doing the particular thing I want?" You shouldn't ask why a car doesn't start, you should ask if the ignition is broken and if it's frozen over.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you're asking computing questions, specifics must be joined with it's twin, context. Provide context. What programming language are you using? What are you trying to achieve? If you provide code examples (more on this later), asking 'why doesn't the below work?' without telling others what outcome is desired, you won't get an answer. Not really. You should be able to point out what is not working, and how you are approaching your desired outcome.
				<br>
				<br>
				When providing code examples, do not, I repeat, DO NOT post the whole of your code. Try and find the relevant bits and then post those. This will require forethought and maybe some research on your part. The opposite of this mistake is posting too little. Putting one line of code from a Ruby class without telling anyone what the class does helps no one. It wastes time.
				<br>
				<br>
				Lastly, keep in mind people who are reading this may also be looking for a solution to a similar problem. Be quick and concise. Tag everything appropriately. Make the title of your question descriptive. Someone should be able to read the title and know exactly what you are trying to find out. Make sure your code is descriptive too. If you are trying to figure out how to make a reverse method, name it that. Don't call it <code>thingmethod</code> or somesuch.
				<br>
				<br>
				Specifics, context, readibility. That should help you find some answers!
