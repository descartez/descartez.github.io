			Cultural Post: If You're Programming, and I'm Programming; Who's Flying the Plane?
		</h1>
		<p>
			The term "feedback loop" is usally a bad thing; a screeching sound that comes from a speaker as a microphone picks up the sound of said speaker. Usually, that building of energy is not great. In the case of feedback from your peers though, it's a good thing. As long as you keep your feedback is Actionable, Specific, and Kind, it becomes a foundation rather than an ear-splitting shriek. I might be mixing metaphors there. Or cement. Because foundation. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Before feedback can be given, things need to be done. Pairing Sessions being one of them. Going in I was really nervous about doing well and how it would all work out. How would we get things done? Would using video calls really be that effective? I tie myself into space when I learn, what's around me and who I am with is how I structure my thoughts and memory. It's a little hard to do that when who I am "with" isn't really there. So I have to be more deliberate when pairing, being present and giving input and feedback constantly. Where each of us are, how we think about a problem. Who's driving? Who's navigating? Do one or both of us have an idea of what to do?
			<br>
			<br>
			Provided communication is open, you can usually get through a challenge quickly and efficiently. I've found I'm more focused and intentional when I'm working with another. I have to be. Otherwise we just stare at the screen saying "I got nothin'". That can happen anyway, but it's easier if you are honest and checking in often. I've learned that if that deadlock happens, take some time to look at the problem and break it down with your pair. If that doesn't yield and results, don't be afraid to end the session. I've found that the answer comes to me a little while later. Let your brain stew and relax. You come up with some great ideas in the shower and when you're going to bed because you're brain is always working. Give it some space, and don't give up.

			Starting the Loop
		</h2>
		<p>
			I usually leave feedback immediately after I finish a pairing session while the experience is still fresh. As I said before, Specific, Actionable, and Kind feedback is best. Others will be doing the same for you, so you can know where your weaknesses are and how to help those along. It's tough to come up with that sort of thing sometimes, but it's good. Being specific is my problem. "It was all great! Nothing went bad! You are smart!" Kind, but doesn't really say much about what to do or how to do it. My first few pieces of feedback weren't helping anyone.
			<br>
			<br>
			Reading feedback wasn't too stressful for me, not once I actually did it. The moments before I actually looked at them though was a bit anxiety producing. But, everyone was following the same rules I was (though many of them were far better than I). There was no need to be nervous, we are all trying to help each other along. You can also rate feedback given, so feedback upon other's feedback helps everyone write better feedback. So feedback on feedback = good. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Learning is much easier when you can see your problems and correct. That's the point of checking in when you're pairing, and writing feedback after. If you keep that loop tight enough, you can adjust within a few hours if you're deliberate. That's remarkably helpful and advantageous when you're spending most of your days trying something that you have never done before. I know now that I should not be afraid to say I don't know something (because if I don't I am not helping at all with nodding my head and saying "sure"). I should make sure I'm not controlling the situation, driving and navigating when I should only have <em>one</em> of those jobs. 
			<br>
			<br>
			At the same time, I also know what others value about me. I'm very positive and am excited to be present. I am concise and clear about my experience. I keep working at a problem even though our pairing session is done. Smartest dog in the pack or no, once I get my teeth in something substantial, I'm going to keep on it. 
			<br>
			<br>
			That's the beauty of a tight loop. I can address my weaknesses and notice my strengths far more easily and specifically than if I was doing it all alone. It's nice, knowing you aren't alone.
