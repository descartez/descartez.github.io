			Reflection: Polishing a Stone
		</h1>
		<p>
			This website hasn't been up for all that long. That means it has a few rough edges. There's always ways to improve. That's not a problem, that's an opportunity! So I fixed some issues that I noticed right from the start: I fixed the fonts. The default font was not great to look at, and increased reader fatigue. Very important.
			<br>
			<br>
			Then I made sure that every post I had made used the same headers, h1 for the start, h2 from any subsequent header. I like to use them to section off content, so they should look consistent throughout.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What others thought
		</h2>
		<p>
			The people that looked at my site didn't have much to change. The color scheme was solid, and it was easy to read. (See? Changing fonts are important!) I also changed the spacing between the bottom of the headers and the written content.
			Fixed one or two broken links and make the written content's width equal to the width of the headers and BAM! More polish.
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm glad that people found it easy to read, and they enjoyed the posts I have made. But I'm not done. I've still got a lot to learn, and a lot to do.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Future plans
		</h2>
		<p>
			This site is my professional face, and an ongoing Dev Boot Camp project. I need to build it better, faster, stronger. I'd love to use Jekyll as a platform. I've been building a toy site to mess with it and learn more about it. It's blog-aware, so it has many functions built right in. Best one thus far (and the one that gets me the most excited) is how it formats your pages.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I'm writing a post like this, I'm writing it as an HTML doc. That's not too bad, but if I decide to change how I format content (or I make a mistake that I don't catch until much later), I have to change every post and page. Not ideal. Jekyll has all the content you write as text files, and then uses whatever framework you've made, applying it to all your content when the site loads.
			<br>
			<br>
			If I want to do an overhaul of the site, I don't have to change every page's HTML. I can be more modular. And I love modular.
			<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, I want more of my own graphics. I love making graphics (I did freelance graphics and illustration for a while), and I'd love to have more of my own aesthetic applied to my site. It should reflect my skills, and my designs.
			<br>
			<br>
			There's always work to do. But everything's a process: life, love, even this website. I like a challenge.
