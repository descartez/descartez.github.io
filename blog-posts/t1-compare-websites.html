		<h3>DBC Week 1, Challenge 11: Comparing Websites</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>The Goal:</strong> Compare three websites and their design in order to better understand said design.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>The Sites:</strong>
				<a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>;
				<a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>;
				<a href="https://cracked.com">Cracked</a>;
			<br>
			<br>
			Two of the sites here you have already heard of, considering one is a major social network, and another is a major blogging platform (which just got bough by Yahoo! in the past year). Number three on the list, Cracked, is a popular comedy website. I have no idea if you know about it or not. Top notch humor articles and videos, all of it original content. It is a specific type of humor though, which may not be everyone's cup of brown, sometimes caffienated beverage.
			<br>
			Let's get to it then shall we?
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em><strong>Facebook:</strong></em>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src="../imgs/facebook-example.png">
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					There is a lot going on here. But it doesn't seem to cluttered. Not at all.
					<br>
					Notice the colors? Nice relaxing blues and neutral white. That's intentional. Blue makes people relax and more comfortable, which is a good choice if your site is all about sharing personal info. White is inoffensive, so it's a good companion to the blues. It also means that you are willing to spend more time on the site because there is very little eye strain.
					<br>
					This site solves a problem elegantly: How to share my own thoughts, things I've found, and experiences and informing me of others' experiences as well. The Update option is tied directly into the Feed, where everyone else is posting. The design keeps what you share and what others share connected.
					<br>
					Whether that content in the Feed is good or not is up to you. You can customize your feed, eliminate posts you dislike, and the site learns from those choices. 
				</li>
