With the world being what it is, telecoms getting tighter control over networks, and surveillance projects like [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)){:target="_blank"} around, decentralizing communication and hiding it from surveillance is more important than ever.

### Hot Ninja
If you haven't seen [vtol's Hot Ninja](https://www.hackster.io/vtol/vtol-hot-ninja-da2cee){:target="_blank"} project, I highly reccomend it.

Summary:

> Multifunctional network device for autonomous activity in the city environment. Its main function is communication and propaganda through the Wi-Fi wireless standard. This is the hacktivism diy response to attempts by the authorities in different countries to control the Internet. The project serves as an example of the possible opposition and decentralisation of networks to ensure communications and provide notifications irrespective of whether there is access to the global internet or certain restrictions are applied.

I've been thinking about this kind of project for a while, and I'm happy that someone has thought of a way to implement it. My only criticism is that it keeps the chats as a log on the device itself. I had never thought of a way to provide multiple networks before.
