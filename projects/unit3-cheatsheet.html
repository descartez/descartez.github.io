			<h1>Intro</h1>
			<p>
				Design is what makes things look nice, work well, and feel good. It's an art and a science. It also is very intimidating. Be not afraid! Even if you aren't the artsiest of farts, you too can learn what makes things look nice. And if not that, probably at least the terms designers use to describe those lines, shapes, and colors that can be so intimidating. Design follows rules, so even if you can't sculpt the Statue of David, you can at least articulate why it looks nice.

				Good luck!

			<h2>The Golden Ratio and Rule of Thirds</h2>
			<p>
				In this section, you'll see the prettiest curve, square, and rectangle you'll ever see. I know this because the ratios that make it up show up everywhere. That's the Golden Ratio, which makes up the Golden Spiral, Square, and Rectangle respectively. The actual mathematical ratio:

				<br>
				Don't worry about that. Just know that all through design there is this thing. It looks nice. So if you're going to split things into two sections, maybe consider breaking it apart the way the golden rectangle and square fit together.
				<br>
				<br>
				The second idea is about sectioning out as well. The Rule of Thirds. Humans like having a right, a center, and a left. Or a top, center, and bottom. I don't know why. Maybe it's because we grew up on plains, and like to scan the horizon or up a mountain. The Rule of Thirds also follows the Golden Ratio. Have a little section, and then two sections of equal size.

			<h2>Symmetry, Assymetry</h2>
			<p>
				Symmetry is when both sides of a thing look the same, centered text is symmetrical to a degree. Assymetry is when both sides of a thing don't match. This site is assymetrical. The Golden Rectangle/Square combo is assymmetrical. But that's a good thing! Sometimes, we don't need everything to be centered and equal on all sides. Look at your favorite websites, what is symmetrical? Assymetrical? Here's the important bit: It doesn't matter if something is symmetrical/assymetrical. What matters is balance.

			<h2>Balance</h2>
			<p>
				Balance is about how much the eye is drawn to part or another. It's just like balancing in the real world. A large shape on one side can be balanced by another large shape on another. Or a group of small shapes can be balanced by a slightly larger shape on another side. Keep in mind, the eye is a mechanism. It follows a z-pattern. Top left to top right, diagonal to bottom left, then to bottom right. You can change how the eye works by making things appear in that path. Think about balancing graphics like balancing weight.

			<h2>Scale and Space</h2>
			<p>
				Scale is the proportion of an object and space is the distance between that object and another. Scale is not just about size, but about how much space it takes up in regards to those things around it, and how the width of an object relates to its height. Space is just distance. On this site, do you see how I've padded the text so that it stays away from the borders? If I hadn't done that the text would seem constrained and crowded. Everything needs a little space. That's why we have spaces in between words!

			<h2>Size</h2>
			<p>
				Size is how big something is. That's it. Size is governed by scale. Ironic that the size article will probably be the smallest thing here.
			</p>

		<article class="post">
			<h2>Weight</h2>
			<p>
				We touched on weight before. Weight is how drawn the eye is to a particular object. You can give an object more weight by changing its size, its color, even the color of things around it. For example, a light grey dot on a white background has some weight. Put it on a black background, and suddenly it really pops. If this text was black, you would have a harder time reading it. But since it's grey, you can read it easily.

			<h1>Green: Color</h1>
			<h2>Hue</h2>
			<p>
				Hue is what the layman would call color. It's the mixure of red, yellow, and blue (if you are mixing paint) or the mixture of red, green, and blue (if you are mixing light). But that doesn't tell you much. How light is it? How dark? Hue is just a mixture of primary colors, and has nothing to do with the Value or the Intensity of the color.
			</p>

		<article class="post">
			<h2>Value and Contrast</h2>
			<p>
				Value is how dark or light a color is. How close it is to white or black. Contrast is the difference in one objects value compared to another. That light grey dot on a white background we talked about? The reason why it wouldn't look great is because there's not a lot of contrast. The eye is drawn to contrast. Black, white, and red are the first colors a baby is drawn to and can fully see when it opens its eyes. That's why this text isn't white, but is instead black. Black reads better on this light green because of our instinctual love of contrast.

			<h2>Intensity and Saturation</h2>
			<p>
			Intensity and Saturation are pretty much the same thing. It's how much of a primary color you have in the mix that makes up one color. See Van Gogh there? The first has no saturation. The second is normal. The third is high saturation, with all red, green, and blue values cranked up.
