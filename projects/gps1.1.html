                    <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's working with another person to reach a stated programming goal. It allows you to learn from others, which can be more helpful than researching on your own. Having another set of eyes means you can also catch bugs or simple mistakes that you wouldn't see otherwise.

                    <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
                    <p>
                       Sharing what you know is a way to cultivate learning.
                       We're not going there to read from a textbook. With all the work we are going to have to do, and the sheer volume of it, it's good to have some comrades-in-arms. Cooperation is also a standard in the professional field, so practice is important.

                    <p>
                        Driver:
                        The person writing the code, trying things out. 

                        Navigator:
                        Keeps big-picture in mind, directs to goal.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first Group Pairing Session was great. I prefer working with others. It's easier for me to connect what I've learned with what others know.Cooperation is something that is very important to me. Any project I worked on in college showed me that when I'm with a team, solving problems collectively, I find it's easier for me to focus. It's fun as well!
