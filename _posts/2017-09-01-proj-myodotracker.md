> Patented as of July 2018. Created because I noticed a need. Before this project, machine uptime was tracked using a bike odometer and time was logged at the end of the day. Initially Python scripts ran on Raspberry Pis to send data from machine to a Rails API, which built reports and crunched numbers regarding job costs, operator performance, and material used. Project now implements a PHP backend. I managed the project, acting as the go-between for the developers and management. I still consult on this project.
