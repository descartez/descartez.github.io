> Patent pending project. Created because I noticed a need. Before this project, machine uptime was tracked using a bike odometer and time was logged at the end of the day. Python scripts run on Raspberry Pis to send data from machine to PHP API, which builds reports to crunch numbers regarding job costs, operator performance, and material used. I manage the project, acting as the go-between for the developers and management.

**Contributions:** Functionality

**Technologies** Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
